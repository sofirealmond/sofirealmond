- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Soph and I hate capitalism. I got into coding because I'm just old enough to remember when seeing even a single ad on a website was a sign that it was dodgy and would probably give you a virus, so I'm very angry at the current state of the internet. After seeing website after website sell out and watching the whole internet become nigh-unusable without 5 million browser extensions, I figured the only way to find an online haven untouched by the corrupt hands of advertisers and cryptobros is to create my own.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web/app design and possibly game development in the distant future.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript
